## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

As demonostrated by the linear regression summary below:

- Vehicle length and ground clearance both provide statistically significant impact on mpg. This is clear because the p-value for each is less than .05. 
- The slope of the linear model is not considered zero. A slope in any one variable means there will be a slope in the overall linear mode. The chart shows multiple slopes as demonstrated by the 'estimate' in the chart above.
- The Multiple R-Square of 0.6825 effectively denonstrates that this linear model does effectively predict the mpg of MechCar prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

- Overall: As shown below, the variance of 62.3 demonstrates the combined manufacturing lots do meet this required design specification.

- Individual lots: As shown below, Lots 1 and 2 also meet the design specificatnt for variance at .98 and 7.47 respectively.  However, Lot 3 is not meeting this specification as demonstrated by the variance of 170.24.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
